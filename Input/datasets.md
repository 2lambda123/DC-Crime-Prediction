### Problem Areas, Potential Questions, and Additional Resources

In consultation with the Lab @ DC, we've organized questions into three main problem areas.  You are not limited to addressing these questions, but they are some of the questions that are currently of interest to The Lab!
____________
### Problem Areas

- **Crime-Related**:
  - Does crime go up when street lights go out? (This is actually an open data science project that The Lab is working on right now, led by a volunteer. You can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/thelabdc/lights-and-crime). You could pick up an existing thread or start from the ground up!)
  - Can we predict how many people are going to be in jail or released from jail? Are there issues associated with this, such as overcrowding? Are there (evidence-based) steps that could be taken to avoid some of these issues?
  - Do wireless hotspots or security cameras reduce crime?
  - If we built similar models to predict gunshots and to predict 311 calls (using the same predictors, say) what might we learn from comparing the model parameters and predictions?
  - Using [this](https://github.com/thelabdc/NEAR-Act-Public) data:
    - Can we tell if being charged with one crime is highly predictive of also being charged with certain other crimes, or: 
    - Are there other factors that predict a combination of offenses (e.g. maybe arrests in specific locations are more likely to have specific combinations of charges)
  - DC makes available [crime incident location data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2017). Using that data:
    - Can you build a model to predict or explain crime? (Note: you can use continuously update [2018 Data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2018) as a real-life test set.)
    - Can you merge this dataset with another dataset to explore the relationship between crime and, e.g. house prices, parking tickets, 311 requests, or certain city infrastruture?
   - Can [ShotSpotter Data](https://mpdc.dc.gov/publication/shotspotter-data-disclaimer-and-dictionary) be used to predict gunshots or violent crime in DC?.
      -  These data are generated by "acoustic surveillance" to locate gunshots in real-time. According to Eric at The Lab, ShotSpotter is the best unbiased indicator of violence in the city.
      - ShotSpotter data from other cities can be found [here](http://justicetechlab.org/shotspotter-data/).
      - You may be interested in [Jennifer Doleac](http://jenniferdoleac.com/research/)'s research. She has used these data to examine whether DC's youth curfew reduces violence, and has examined how ambient light influences criminal behavior.

- **Property-Related**:
  - Can you identify different features from an [aerial image](http://opendata.dc.gov/pages/dc-from-above) in order to predict whether a house is vacant, or identify the type of property?
  - Using [Real Property Values](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=real%20property):
    - Can you estimate or assess housing values based on aerial imagery, voter file data, and other information?
    - Can we make inferences about property values or demographic trends given construction and occupancy permits?

- **Forecasting**:
  - Can we forecast service needs around DC based on [311 service calls](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=service%20requests) and other data?
  - Can we forecast [traffic accidents, moving violations, and parking tickets](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=parking%20violations&sort=-updatedAt)? Based on these forecasts, can we make policy recommendations, forecast revenue, or 
  - Can we build a voter turnout model to predict the likelihood that someone will vote. Data data are available from the Board of Elections for $5 on a CD. If you build the model before the June primary, youâ€™ll have a built-in test set!
