# DC Crime Prediction
A team repo  for  project 5 for Client with The Lab @ DC (GA-DSI)

# Settings
  1) Make sure you have `.gitignore` in your local repo by adding this line: `input/csr/*`
  2. Download  with out forking so that we can work and push on things we have done
  3) Make sure you install and track Git Large File Storage(read more: https://git-lfs.github.com)
    - `git lfs install`, `git lfs track "*.csv"`
    - this will create  `.gitattributes` in your local repository.

# Approaches
pproaches and Deliverables with DC crime Prediction 
**Approach** 
   - Determine which variables provide the highest correlation with crime incidents 
   - Visualize incidents in a map for different choices of variables and filters 
   - Heatmaps, kernel density estimate plots to correlate variables 
**Feature selection**
 - Time series analysis on variables 
  - Identify seasonal effects 
  - Determine anomalies 
  **Prediction models** 
   Regression (to determine the evolution of patterns over time) Clustering (to determine common patterns across census tracts, Wards or ANC, etc.) Classification (to predict if a given crime is likely to happen in a given time and location) 
  **Deliverables**
  -  A notebook including: Analysis of crime patterns Models for predicting crime
