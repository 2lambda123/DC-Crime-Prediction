### Project 5: The Lab @ DC Consulting Project

The[Lab @ DC](http://thelab.dc.gov/) is an organization within [DC Mayor Muriel Bowser's](https://mayor.dc.gov/biography/muriel-bowser) office that is responsible for testing and evaluating policies and providing analysis to agencies within the DC government. In a word, The Lab is DC's own data science shop.

[Eric Foster-Moore](http://thelab.dc.gov/eric.html), a data scientist at The Lab, will help us kick off this project on Thursday, June 14th. He will speak about the types of problems that The Lab seeks to address for the city, the specific questions which are formulated and answered by data scientists at The Lab, and the ways in which their findings are communicated to stakeholders.

# Approaches

Approaches and Deliverables with the DC crime Prediction 

**Approaches** 

          - Determine which variables provide the highest correlation with crime incidents based on the data of Crime incidents  from 2012-2018 datasets
          - Visualize crime incidents  
          - Heatmaps and Visual estimate plots to correlate variables 

**Feature selection**

          - Time series analysis on variables across the time period of 2012-2018 
          - Identify seasonal effects by week, month, weekdays,quarters of the year and annual
          - Determine anomalies on the Dataset based on shift,PSA,Ward,Start and end date 

  **Prediction models** 

          - Regression (to determine the evolution of patterns over time,by Age of the crime, length of time to respond) Clustering (to determine common patterns across census tracts, Wards, etc.) Classification (to predict if a given crime is likely to happen in a given time and location) 

  **Deliverables**
          - A notebook including: Analysis of crime patterns Models for predicting crime

**Problem Areas, Potential Questions, and Additional Resources**

        In consultation with the Lab @ DC, we've organized questions into three main problem areas.  You are not limited to addressing these questions, but they are some of the questions that are currently of interest to The Lab!
____________
**Problem Areas**

- **Crime-Related**:

  - Does crime go up when street lights go out? (This is actually an open data science project that The Lab is working on right now, led by a volunteer. You can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/thelabdc/lights-and-crime). You could pick up an existing thread or start from the ground up!)

  - Can we predict how many people are going to be in jail or released from jail? Are there issues associated with this, such as overcrowding? Are there (evidence-based) steps that could be taken to avoid some of these issues?

  - Do wireless hotspots or security cameras reduce crime?
  - If we built similar models to predict gunshots and to predict 311 calls (using the same predictors, say) what might we learn from comparing the model parameters and predictions?
  - Using [this](https://github.com/thelabdc/NEAR-Act-Public) data:
    - Can we tell if being charged with one crime is highly predictive of also being charged with certain other crimes, or: 

    - Are there other factors that predict a combination of offenses (e.g. maybe arrests in specific locations are more likely to have specific combinations of charges)
  - DC makes available [crime incident location data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2017). Using that data:

    - Can you build a model to predict or explain crime? (Note: you can use continuously update [2018 Data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/crime-incidents-in-2018) as a real-life test set.)
    - Can you merge this dataset with another dataset to explore the relationship between crime and, e.g. house prices, parking tickets, 311 requests, or certain city infrastruture?

-**Property-Related**:

   - Can you identify different features from an [aerial image](http://opendata.dc.gov/pages/dc-from-above) in order to predict whether a house is vacant, or identify the type of property?
  - Using [Real Property Values](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=real%20property):
    - Can you estimate or assess housing values based on aerial imagery, voter file data, and other information?
    - Can we make inferences about property values or demographic trends given construction and occupancy permits?

- **Forecasting**:

  - Can we forecast service needs around DC based on [311 service calls](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=service%20requests) and other data?
  - Can we forecast [traffic accidents, moving violations, and parking tickets](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets?q=parking%20violations&sort=-updatedAt)? Based on these forecasts, can we make policy recommendations, forecast revenue, or 
  - Can we build a voter turnout model to predict the likelihood that someone will vote. Data data are available from the Board of Elections for $5 on a CD. If you build the model before the June primary, youâ€™ll have a built-in test set!

Case-Shiller Index of US residential house prices. Data comes from S&P
Case-Shiller data and includes both the national index and the indices for 20
metropolitan regions. The indices are created using a repeat-sales methodology.

**Data**
==================================================================================================
As per the [home page for Indices on S&P website][sp-home]:

> The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index is a composite of
> single-family home price indices for the nine U.S. Census divisions and is
> calculated monthly. It is included in the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index
> Series which seeks to measure changes in the total value of all existing
> single-family housing stock.

Documentation of the methodology can be found at:
<http://www.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-cs-home-price-indices.pdf>

Key points are (excerpted from methodology):

*      The indices use the "repeat sales method" of index calculation which uses
     data on properties that have sold at least twice, in order to capture the
     true appreciated value of each specific sales unit.
*    The quarterly S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index aggregates nine
    quarterly U.S. Census division repeat sales indices using a base period a nd
     estimates of the aggregate value of single family housing stock for those periods.
*   The S&P/Case - Shiller Home Price Indices originated in the 1980s by Case
     Shiller Weiss's research principals, Karl E. Case and Robert J. Shiller. At
    the time, Case and Shiller developed the repeat sales pricing technique. This
   methodology is recognized as the most reliable means to measure housing price
   movements and is used by other home price ind ex publishers, including the
   Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO)

## Preparation

   To download and process the data do:

    python scripts/process.py

   Updated data files will then be in `data` directory.

   Note: the URLs and structure of the source data have evolved over time with the
  source data URLs changing on *every release*.

   Originally (2013) the site provided a table of links but these are not direct
   file URLs and you have dig around in S&P's javascript to find the actual
   download locations. As of mid-2014 the data is consolidated in one primary XLS
   but the HTML you see in your browser and the source HTML are different. In
   addition, the actual location of the XLS file continues to change on each
   release.

**DATA DICTIONARY**

**Attributes to Remove**

The below table provides a description of attributes that will be removed because they provide little to no predictive power for the Washington DC Metropolitant Police Department crime incident report.

================================================================================================
  |Attribute|Description|Removal Reason|
  |:------|:----------|:-------------|

  |OFFENSE| The category of crime committed.| This attribute is redundant with OFFENSE_Code. It will be stored off for its labels.|
  |METHOD| The category of the method used to commit the crime.| This attribute is redundant with METHOD_Code. It will be stored off for its labels.|
  |DISTRICT| The police district.| This attribute was replaced earlier preprocessing to create DistrictID.|
  |PSA| Police Service Area| This attribute was replaced earlier preprocessing to create PSA_ID.|
  |WARD| The political Ward identifier.| WARD can be derived from NEIGHBORHOOD_CLUSTER which provides a smaller geographic resolution.|
  |CENSUS_TRACT| Land management tract identifier.| This attribute is superceded by other geographical data.|
  |VOTING_PRECINCT| Political subdivision| This attribute is superceded by other geographical data.|
  |CCN| Criminal Complaint Number - unique to each report| An index for the crime report.|

===================================================================================================
**Attributes to Keep**

The below table provides a description of attributes that will be used for predicting crimeincidents in DC.
===================================================================================================
|Attribute|Description|Role|
|:------|:----------------|:----:|
|ANC| Advisory Neighborhood Commission that is a geo-political grouping. This is our target attribute.| Feature and Target|
|NEIGHBORHOOD_CLUSTER|Neighborhood identifier that subdivides police wards.| Feature|

|Latitude| The angular distance of the crime North of the earth's equator| Feature|
|Longitude| The angular distance of the crime West of the meridian at Greenwich, England| Feature|



**Attributes  Added to the crime incident report from different sources**
=========================================================================================================


        Our team was able to acquire data on the unemployment rates and housing prices for each of the 8 wards based on year. Of course, no data comes into play without the need for sufficient munging! A separate excel file was created to help fill the gaps with a multitude of INDEX/MATCH functions accross several sheets. The unemployment rates were also incomplete in a sense it was only yearly for the 8 wards, but the housing prices data  we were using different informations for cross validation. 


       Our team felt it was important to bring to light a characteristic about Theft and Robbery which may not be so apparent just by looking at the data set. It is important to take note that while Theft and Robberies may have a higher rate in certain neighborhoods, it is likely that those who are committing the crime most likely live in a completely separate location. It is highly unlikely that a suspect would steal from their neighbors, risking the higher chance of being caught with readily recognizable stolen goods[Here we just taking common sense]. On the other hand, those areas which may have a higher drug use may experience exactly this as the neighborhood may have a different dynamic with respect to a communal mindset which may exist in other neighborhoods[areas with high sex abuse and violent crime areas]. As is usually the case, if there were more data readily available about the suspect[identity,like age,location,status,demographics] as well as the victimology involved[by age and sex], there very well may be the possibility of being able to measure these aspects.

**Dataset Explanations**

       we have two potential response variables: Crime_Type (nonviolent crime vs. Violent crime), and Offense_Code (The more specific type of offense: Homicide, Robbery, Theft, Arson, etc.). The goal is to provide the Metropolitant police Department with a model that can predict or classify a crime based on the available explanatory variables collected from the opendatadc as well as from the MPD website.

       One problem with this data is that the victim profile data is missing (due to privacy concerns, and the fact that non violent crimes are not necessarily because of the owner's profile). The explanatory variables for this dataset focus on time and locations. We believe that the detection/classification of a Violent crime would be based primarily on the victim's characteristics, and not exclusively on the location or time. The other problem with this data is that (fortunately) there are far fewer violent crimes than there are nonviolent crimes (approximately 83% of the 36000+ crime reports are against nonviolent rather than persons), so we have very imbalanced classification.

       Our exploration of the variables seem to indicate that time (not necessarily the day, but the time during the day) is one of the more significant factors[this was the visualization and we need to see for our prediction and modeling]. We saw this in the SHIFT variable (which gives the Police duty shift that responded to the call). When we broke the time down into individual hours of the day, we saw a pronounced cyclic effect, where night-time crimes were far more likely than daytime crimes[see feature selection and visualization notebook]. Weekend crimes were slightly more likely than crimes during the work week[visualization by week ], and monthly trends appeared to be opposite intuition (fall crimes were more likely than winter or summer crimes).The quarterly crime shows an increase during the second and third quarters as compared to the first and fourth quarter of the year.

       Location also appeared to have some influence, but the way the locations were grouped altered the effect significantly[the visualizationon notebook three by PSA]. Different political areas (Wards and the subordinate Association Neighborhood Committees) showed a different trend than using global locations (Latitude and Longitude). Police districts (and their subordinate Police Service Areas(PSA) showed a different trend than the Ward grouping. This tells us that there are some location effects, but it is difficult to separate them out due to the correlation between geo-physical areas and the different (but overlapping) political mappings[the ward classification based on distance is just not explanatory to justify the crimes]. The top violent crimes show significance across the anacostia river and around the business areas of the district, near the white house and all around the Georgia Avenue and towards the North East side of DC and areas bordering the Prince Georgecounty.
