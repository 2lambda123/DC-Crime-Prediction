# DC-Crime-Prediction
Project 5: Approaches and Deliverables with DC crime Prediction Approach Determine which variables provide the highest correlation with crime incidents Visualize incidents in a map for different choices of variables and filters Heatmaps, kernel density estimate plots to correlate variables Feature selection Time series analysis on variables Identify seasonal effects Determine anomalies  Prediction models Regression (to determine the evolution of patterns over time) Clustering (to determine common patterns across census tracts, boroughs, etc.) Classification (to predict if a given crime is likely to happen in a given time and location) Deliverables A notebook including: Analysis of crime patterns Models for predicting crime
